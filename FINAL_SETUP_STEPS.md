# ✅ FINAL SETUP STEPS

## 🎉 What's Been Completed:

1. ✅ **Firebase Admin SDK credentials** added to `.env.local`
2. ✅ **Admin role set** for joseph@crucibleanalytics.dev
3. ✅ **Production Firestore rules** restored
4. ✅ **Cache cleared**
5. ✅ **Google Maps API** configured

## 🔥 FINAL STEP: Deploy Firestore Rules

You have **TWO OPTIONS** to deploy the production rules:

### 🎯 OPTION 1: Firebase Console (Recommended - Easiest)

1. **Open Firebase Console:**
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/k9-trials-tracker/firestore/rules

2. **Copy the rules:**
   - Open `firestore.rules` in your project
   - Copy the entire file contents (already switched to production rules)

3. **Paste and Publish:**
   - In Firebase Console, delete all existing rules
   - Paste the new rules
   - Click **"Publish"**

---

### 🎯 OPTION 2: Firebase CLI (Advanced)

```bash
# 1. Login to Firebase
firebase login --reauth

# 2. Set project
firebase use k9-trials-tracker

# 3. Deploy rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

---

## 🚀 Start Your Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then navigate to: http://localhost:3000

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After deploying Firestore rules and starting the dev server:

1. ✅ Log out and log back in
2. ✅ Try creating an event
3. ✅ Google Maps autocomplete should work
4. ✅ No "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors
5. ✅ No 401 errors for bootstrap-admin
6. ✅ You should see admin features in the dashboard

## 🔄 If You Need to Switch Back to Dev Rules

If you ever need more permissive rules for development:

firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

To switch back to production:

```bash
cp firestore.rules.prod firestore.rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**If you still get permission errors:**
1. Make sure you deployed the Firestore rules
2. Log out and log back in to refresh your token
3. Check that your email in Firebase Auth is `joseph@crucibleanalytics.dev`

**If Google Maps doesn't work:**
1. Check `.env.local` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
2. Restart your dev server
3. Clear browser cache

**If bootstrap-admin gives 401:**
1. Make sure you're logged in
2. Check `.env.local` has Firebase Admin credentials
3. Restart your dev server

## 🎯 You're Almost Done!

Just deploy the Firestore rules and start your dev server. Everything else is set up and ready to go!
